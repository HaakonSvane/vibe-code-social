# The Hitchhikers Guide to Vibe Coding
Welcome to Connascence's first Code Social of the year.

In this Code Social, you will be testing out the latest and greatest AI-tech that is enabled for us developers in Bouvet.
We will be coding using Agent mode (VS Code or any preffered IDE that supports it) to create a fullstack application of your liking.

Depending on how far you come, we will progressively add more and more to the stack, until it hopefully resembles a technology stack and architecture we are used to from work.


### App registrations
For AuthN/Z, we have created two app registrations for you to mess around with in the Bouvet tenant:

__vibe code social - client: {client id}__
> Has API permissions to vibe code social - api
 

__vibe code social - api: {client id}__
> Let me know if you need a secret for authentication.
