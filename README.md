# The Hitchhikers Guide to Vibe Coding
Welcome to Connascence's first Code Social of the year.

In this Code Social, you will be testing out the latest and greatest AI-tech that is enabled for us developers in Bouvet.
We will be coding using Agent mode (VS Code or any preffered IDE that supports it) to prototype a fullstack application of your liking.

Depending on how far you come, we will progressively add more and more to the stack, until it hopefully resembles a something we are used to from work.

# How do I procede from here?
After you have been assigned a pairing, your task is to create any full-stack application you'd like. You may use gen AI to help iron out an idea you have, or head into the `./app-ideas` directory for a set of ideas to get you started. The ideas mainly serve as a guideline, and you (and your AI partner) may of course modify them to you and your parntner(s) likings.

## AI tips and tricks
After messing around with agent mode for a couple of months, experiences learned on the way that might help you get better results are found in `./ai-tips.md`. Note that this is tested on VS Code only. Most commonly used IDE's (Visual Studio, Rider) support AI chat, but all features mentioned in this post have not been tested.
