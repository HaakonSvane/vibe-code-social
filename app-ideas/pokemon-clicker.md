# Pokemon Clicker
An interactive Pokémon clicker game (inspired by Cookie Clicker) where you choose a starter Pokémon and train it by clicking — either on your Pokémon or on opponents you battle — to earn cash and XP.
Spend your earnings to buy items, unlock evolutions, and hire click-helpers to automate training. Progress through gyms, collect rare Pokémon, and build the ultimate team!

## Technology bullet points
- PokeAPI – for fetching sprites, Pokémon data, stats, and evolutions (tip: check their premade wrapper libraries for faster integration)
- Stored user sessions
