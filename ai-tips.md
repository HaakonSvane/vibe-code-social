# Agent mode
Agent mode is a chat mode that gives the AI model access to reading and writing directly into your codebase. Its suggestions are presented to you as a diff and you may keep, modify or reject changes section by section.

# Architectural respect
Unless specified by you, the agent tends to come up with its own solutions to your problem. Being the craftspersons we are, you might feel that its proposals are _hacky_ and _lacking in vision for the grand scheme of things_. This is partly your fault for not specifying up front. Make sure the AI either has a well established codebase architecture in place to work on, or specify how you would like it to solve a problem.
